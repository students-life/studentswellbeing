      The majority of us believe that UUM's inability to adjust to the new norm may result in students lacking sufficient assignments and comprehension of the course they are enrolled in, which may damage their test scores.

      Fortunately, the lecturers at UUM are highly qualified and adept at adapting to changing norms, enabling students to comprehend what they must study to pass the test. Students did not experience anxiety as a result of imprecise teaching or erroneous material since all online lecturers provided revision-friendly slides, notes, and even video replays.

      The majority of students favoured online education over on-site education because they saw it as a more convenient option.
