      Since UUM is a government university, a number of subsidies are available to assist students with financial difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accommodation and transportation costs have been deducted in full from student fees. Many families have been harmed by the Covid-19 outbreak as a result of our country's poor economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To participate in online courses, students are required to have at least one electronic device as a result of the shift from on-campus to online education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students' financial burdens are alleviated by the reduction of student fees during this epidemic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to other private universities, students are appreciative that UUM continues to prioritise students.
